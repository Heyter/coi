## Mapping

Use the `coi.fgd` provided in this repository.

### coi_truck

Place these where you want spawnpoints/loot points to be. Players spawn at the back of these. The gamemode will only make enough teams as there are trucks, so keep in mind the desired game size when placing these.

### coi_money

Place these in the vault. You can put any number of these in, as long as there's at least one.
